**Very simple C++ text-mode Minesweeper-like game**

Uncover fields by entering their coordinates.
Doesn't support automatic empty area uncovering so far, but will be implemented soon. Without that, it works just like every single Minesweeper game, except its gameplay is text-mode.

I will also be porting it to (Free)DOS soon
